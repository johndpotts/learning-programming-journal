How Kindergarten Prepared Me to Be An Agile Developer

One item that is often present in a Kindergarten classroom is a brightly colored list of classroom rules. It is important to have clear, universal rules
when kids are learning how to interact in a classroom setting.
Having recently worked through the agile transformation of a development team, I find the concept of clear and universal guidelines is
just as important for grown ups as for kids. In fact, many of the same rules from Kindergarten remain relevant for agile developers! We may have moved from crayons to code, but many foundational principles of teamwork, scheduling, and organization remain much the same.

With that said, I'd like to explain how following some basic ground rules from Kindergarten can make you an outstanding developer in an agile
environment:

## Rule #1: Play Nicely In The Sandbox
A big part of the move from waterfall to agile is viewing development and testing as one, continuous unit. Instead of handing off code to the next team, we work together to make an
excellent finished product.

## Rule #2: No Running In The Hallway

## Rule #3: Take Turns Speaking


## Rule #4: Be Responsible
