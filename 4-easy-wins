You can't control everything about your job today- but you can guarantee a win.

Sure, many factors that affect your job are outside of your control. You have other people who need to approve things and
other teams you need to partner with to complete projects. You might not have the roles on your team to take on a specific
task or the go-ahead from management to pursue a new opportunity. As such, many of the "big goals", like completing a project or 
advancing in your career aren't in your immediate control.

The key in guaranteeing yourself a win today is to let go of things beyond the scope of your control, and focus on doing the
things you can do with excellence.
