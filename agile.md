How Kindergarten Prepared Me to Be An Agile Developer

One item that is often present in a Kindergarten classroom is a brightly colored list of classroom rules. It is important to have clear, universal rules
when kids are learning how to interact in a classroom setting.
Having recently worked through the agile transformation of a development team, I find the concept of clear and universal guidelines is
just as important for grown ups as for kids. In fact, many of the same rules from Kindergarten remain relevant for agile developers! We may have moved from crayons to code, but many foundational principles of teamwork, scheduling, and organization remain much the same.

With that said, I'd like to explain how following some basic ground rules from Kindergarten can make you an outstanding developer in an agile
environment:

## Rule #1: Play Nicely In The Sandbox
A big part of the move from waterfall to agile is viewing development and testing as one, continuous unit. Instead of handing off code to the next team, we work together to make an
excellent finished product.

## Rule #2: No Running In The Hallway

## Rule #3: Take Turns Speaking


## Rule #4: Be Responsible

## Rule #5: Learn Your ABC's
Ok, maybe this was more of a kindergarten goal than it was a rule, but it reminds me of a key tenant in Agile workflows. 
When teaching a class their ABC's, most teachers do a fantastic job at iterative development. They take a letter of the day, work on that letter, get it to a point where the kids know it well, and move on. No, the kids don't all get together in a "letter refinement session" and assign points to different letters ("Q has got to be at least a 13, it's going to need a bunch of API work..."). Still, tackling one chunk of a larger goal at a time is a great picture of Agile.
