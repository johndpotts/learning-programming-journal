You can't control everything about your job today- but you can guarantee a win.


Sure, many factors that affect your job are outside of your control. You have other people who need to approve things and
other teams you need to partner with to complete projects. You might not have the roles on your team to take on a specific
task or the go-ahead from management to pursue a new opportunity. As a result, many of the "big goals" you'd love to achieve today, 
like completing a project or advancing in your career aren't in your immediate control.


The key to guaranteeing yourself a win today is to let go of things beyond the scope of your control, and focus on doing the
things you can do with excellence.

Here are 6 wins you can claim today that are entirely within your scope of control:

#### 1. Mentor Someone
Mentoring in the small things goes incredibly underrated. It doesn’t have to be a formal, scheduled meeting, either. Doing things as simple as 
a quick code review, sharing a few shortcuts, or explaining the “why” behind a section of code can have a profound impact over time. The 
great thing about taking the time to invest in others is that when you do it, they grow AND you grow as well. Who doesn’t want a teammate 
who is a great teacher and coach?

#### 2. Be Mentored
You might not have an official mentor at your workplace, but you absolutely have the power to seek out mentoring input from others. Find 
people who know things you don’t or who are farther along than you, and learn from them! Trust me, when you intentionally and respectfully seek 
out someone’s input, they will almost always be happy to give it. Seek out people who are great at things you want to be great at, and learn from 
them - even If they aren’t on your team, which leads us to…

#### 3 Network
It never hurts to build relationships across your organization. Even if it's not someone you work with directly, taking time to
get to know people from other teams can be an invaluable investment of time. I live by this simple rule- if the only time I speak with
someone is when I'm asking them for something, I'm doing something wrong. Take the time to eat lunch with people, chat about 
This is even more true for those of you who work remotely. Remote work makes intentionality in relationships exponentially more important;
since you don't physically walk by people in an office setting you need to be disciplined about pursuing relationship-buiding opportunities
throughout the day.

#### 4. Contribute to Your Team
It doesn't matter if you work on a team of 2 or a team of 200- contributing to your team is one of the best (and simplest) wins you
can get today. If you are too caught up in following exactly what your job description lays out, you can miss opportunities to 
aid your team in a big way.

Think about how you can step outside of your job description and contribute to your team. Maybe it's as simple as coming in 5 minutes 
early and straightening up the break room. Maybe it's building an automated tool to help with a mundane task many on your team far.
