## Learning Programming Log:
This isn't perfect, but it's a pretty good record of my day to day tasks as I learned coding! You can navigate through and see what I worked on in different months  below. In summary, I didn't do everything perfectly; you can see for yourself that I did a good amount of bouncing around. Here's what I did well though: I kept working and kept learning, every single day!
