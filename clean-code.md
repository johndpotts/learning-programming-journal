Writing Cleaner Code


1. Use clear, desciptive names for functions and variables
Comments are all well and good, but part of writing clean code is writing in a way that another developer can easily come behind you 
and tell what the code does by looking at it. As fun as it might be to get witty with variable names, it's important that you choose names that 
are descriptive and clearly communicate your intent. For example, a variable 

2. Shorten your functions 

3. Use a consistant style
Consistant style choices go a long way toward making code readable. If you are part of a larger development team, this is all the more important.
My goal in contributing to a team's codebase is to make it hard to tell who wrote a particular line of code without checking the git blame.
Using tools like ESLint and Prettier will go a long way toward making this happen; in fact, if there's one tip I would give to new developers that will
make a huge difference, it's to start using those tools. They make front-end development so much faster and easier, and make youi a better developer for using them.

4. Don't repeat yourself

5. Write a lot of code, then refactor it.
Like many skills, part of becoming a better programmer is simply spending time at it. There is no better way to learn than to build stuff.
I've found it's a far more effective approach than following step-by-step tutorials. Repetition alone won't make your code better, though. Yes,
you need to put in time and lines of code- but going over that same code with a critical eye and refactoring, especially with input from more senior developers,
is equally as important. Practicing the wrong way of doing something over and over won't make you do it right- you need to correct your mistakes,
improve your form, and continue using what you've learned. I've heard it said this way- a developer could have get 5 years of experience under their belt, but
not have progressed very far because it's the same year repeated five times. Practice doesn't make perfect- perfect practice makes perfect. So write a bunch of code, then go back and make it better!
